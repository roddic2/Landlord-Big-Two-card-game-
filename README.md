Game Description:

This is a card game that combines key elements from Dou Dizhu (Landlord) and Big Two, card games in Asia. The player takes on the role of the “landlord” and plays against two computer-controlled opponents. The game emphasizes strategic decision-making, correct card combination, and turn-based play.

Objective:
Be the first player to play all your cards and win the game.

How It Works:
	•	The game uses a standard 54-card deck, including two Jokers.
	•	You (the player) are assigned as the landlord and receive 20 cards.
	•	The two bots each receive 17 cards.
	•	Players take turns playing cards that are stronger than the last play.
	•	A play can either be a single card or a pair of the same rank.
	•	If a player cannot or chooses not to play, they may type PASS.
	•	When two players pass consecutively, the round resets and the last player who made a move starts a new round.

Rules-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Valid Moves:
	•	Single Card: Any single card
	•	Pair: Two cards of the same rank (e.g., 9C 9S)

Card Strength:
	•	Rank Order (lowest to highest):
3 < 4 < 5 < 6 < 7 < 8 < 9 < 10 < J < Q < K < A < 2 < Black Joker < Red Joker
	•	Suit Order (for tie-breaker):
Clubs (C) < Diamonds (D) < Hearts (H) < Spades (S)

Play Rules:
	•	Your play must match the type (single or pair) and be stronger than the last play.
	•	If your play is invalid (not in your hand, invalid combination, or not strong enough), the game will prompt you to try again instead of forcing a pass.
